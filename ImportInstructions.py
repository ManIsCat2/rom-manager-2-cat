This file will contain instructions on how to import RM2C data into the sm64ex-alo repo.
First you should always copy the exported folders (/src,/levels,/sound,/text,/textures,/actors) into your repo.
Then make sure you set RM2C inside the makefile to 1
Then to build for PC use this input to terminal: "make clean && make RM2CPC"
Then to build for N64 use this input to terminal: "make clean && make -j4"
By default, due to their high variability and unique names, no actor data will be included from RM2C output, you must
go per actor and either copy data from a custom.model.inc.c file to the model.inc.c file, or change the includes in group files.

Level specific models will go into a folder inside of /actors/ with the name of the level they belong to. You must copy these folders
over to their level folders. The directory should match the target level dir, and not overwrite any files. Textures should be pre written
to the target level directories.

If you have exported custom behaviors, check the /data/ folder for exported custom behaviors with labels, and associated disassembled functions with matching labels.
These are provided for reference only, they must be manually integrated into the repo.

Below are some warnings generated by RM2C during extraction.
It is expected to have many warnings for editor files and for roms with lots of custom content.

******************************************************************************************

Objects without references must have behaviors created for them, be given an existing behavior, or be commented out.

 Level wf Area 1 has object  Bhv_Custom_0x130002a0 with no known label.
 Level wf Area 1 has object  Bhv_Custom_0x0040eb00 with no known label.
 Level wf Area 1 has object  Bhv_Custom_0x040086a0 with no known label.
 Level wf Area 1 has object  Bhv_Custom_0x1300003c with no known label.

New models are detected by comparing the checksums of textures from the specific model.
The comparison models come from an unedited vanilla rom loaded into Rom Manager.
If a model is in this list, it has either an unrecognized ID or a new texture.
If a model is not in this list, it does not guarantee that it is unedited.

 model custom_DL_19001000_ in folder custom_19001000 has a new model or new textures.
 model custom_DL_19001040_ in folder custom_19001040 has a new model or new textures.
 model custom_DL_19000800_ in folder custom_19000800 has a new model or new textures.
 model custom_DL_19000820_ in folder custom_19000820 has a new model or new textures.
 model unk_DL_04008090_ in folder unk_wf_04008090 has a new model or new textures.
 model Null_DL_0040ef00_ in folder Null_0040ef00 has a new model or new textures.
 model Null_DL_00405e00_ in folder Null_00405e00 has a new model or new textures.
 model Null_DL_003767d4_ in folder Null_003767d4 has a new model or new textures.
******************************************************************************************

Collision models are loaded via behavior, not alongside the model. This means it can be more difficult to detect where exactly the collision belongs.
I attempt to guess based on what model the collision is first used with, but if I'm not sure, it will be logged here.

 Collision custom_DL_19001000 in folder custom_19001000 is unkown or found to be new. Used with Behavior bhvGiantPole.
 Collision custom_DL_19001040 in folder custom_19001040 is unkown or found to be new. Used with Behavior bhvThiHugeIslandTop.
 Collision custom_DL_19000800 in folder custom_19000800 is unkown or found to be new. Used with Behavior Bhv_Custom_0x130001bc.

Known methods of crashing:
*****************************************************************************
ALL BUILDS
IF CRASH ON BOOT - CHECK SEQUENCES
IF TITLE SCREEN LOOP - CHECK START LEVEL IN TWEAKS.H
IF TEXTURES ARE MESSED UP - ALWAYS CHECK LEVEL FOG FIRST
IF ONLY ALPHA TEXTURES MESSED UP - MOVE FOG GEO LAYOUT TO LAYER 1/4 FROM 4/6
IF CRASH UPON ENTERING A LEVEL, CHECK OBJECTS. IF EDITOR, CHECK SCROLLS FIRST. IF NO OBJECTS BAD CHECK SKYBOXES, THEN SEQUENCES
