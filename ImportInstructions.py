This file will contain instructions on how to import RM2C data into the sm64ex-alo repo.
First you should always copy the exported folders (/src,/levels,/sound,/text,/textures,/actors) into your repo.
Then make sure you set RM2C inside the makefile to 1
Then to build for PC use this input to terminal: "make clean && make RM2CPC"
Then to build for N64 use this input to terminal: "make clean && make -j4"
By default, due to their high variability and unique names, no actor data will be included from RM2C output, you must
go per actor and either copy data from a custom.model.inc.c file to the model.inc.c file, or change the includes in group files.

Level specific models will go into a folder inside of /actors/ with the name of the level they belong to. You must copy these folders
over to their level folders. The directory should match the target level dir, and not overwrite any files. Textures should be pre written
to the target level directories.

If you have exported custom behaviors, check the /data/ folder for exported custom behaviors with labels, and associated disassembled functions with matching labels.
These are provided for reference only, they must be manually integrated into the repo.

Below are some warnings generated by RM2C during extraction.
It is expected to have many warnings for editor files and for roms with lots of custom content.
